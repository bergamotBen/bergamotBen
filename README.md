This GitHub account documents my first forays into full stack development. Pull back the curtain and be dazzled by potential. I’ve probably left some sensitive information in at least one of the repos too.

## [DipAdvisor front end](https://github.com/Mdmosley12/DipAdvisor-FrontEnd) and [back end.](https://github.com/Wiggy93/DipAdvisor_API)

Need to find a new lake to cool off in? Fire up your Android emulators! DipAdvisor is a React-Native project for sharing, posting and rating wild swimming locations. This group project was the final phase of the bootcamp. The DipAdvisor back end uses MongoDB and an Express router to fulfil API requests.

## [nc-news front end](https://github.com/bergamotBen/nc-news-fe) and [back end.](https://github.com/bergamotBen/be-nc-news)

This React project pulls together all of the front end skills I learned. I built a CRUD application using JSX, a range of React hooks and front end techniques. [Find the hosted version here](https://magnificent-jelly-b730c4.netlify.app/) I actually do think this is really very pretty.

This is my first PostgreSQL database. It comprises test, development and production environments to simplify testing at each stage of the build.

## [Data Visualisation with React](https://github.com/bergamotBen/react-data-visualisation)

This two-day React sprint helped me learn about making API requests using Axios and presenting them using ChartJS. The data comes from the [National Grid's carbon intensity API.](https://carbonintensity.org.uk/) The API refreshes every thirty minutes and reveals that Scotland’s main source of power is (drumroll please) wind, again. Have a peep and see if it’s changed. You never know.
